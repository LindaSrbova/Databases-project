R1= 

check if BCNF form calculate closures;
- does it go through all the attributes in the relation

lecture{courseID, date, roomNo, building, roomtype, seats}

roomNo,building -> roomtype
roomType -> numberofseats

{roomNo, building}T -> {roomNom building, roomtype, noseats}
no BCNF
so need decomposing roomNO, building:
R1={roomNo, building} =>{roomNo, building, roomtype,seats}
noBCNF form
so decomposing:
R11: {rromtype}+->roomtype, no of seats	yes in BCNF now
R12:{roomtype}-> roomtype UNION R1-R11 -> roomtype, roomNo, building	yes in BCNF now
 

R2={roomNO, building UNION lecture-R1} = {roomno, building, courseID,date}
yes
{roomtype}T->{roomType, noseats}
noBCNF


::breaking down tables with a lot of redundancies
changing orginial lecture with a lot of redundancies to a new one:
 lecture{roomno, building, courseID,date}
 was R11: roomType{roomType, no. of seats}
was R12: room{roomNo, building, roomtype}
