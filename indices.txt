if no index - one cost for reading last page and inserting it

one index only affects only Q1/Q2, not Q2 - total number of pages
insertion - 1 read data, 1 write the data, reading the index, writing the index

one index affects Q1 and one Q2, insertion: read data, write data, read first index, write first index, read first index, write second index


plotting these functions ... at which p1 and p2 we get minimum cost
no indices needed if not many tuples related to the queries


class doesnt have PK then it goes to association
